The module will give you the skills to implement computational models capturing the properties of neural and cognitive functions. Lectures will provide an overview of topics in computational and mathematical modelling in neuroscience, psychophysics, and psychology with an emphasis on the area of expertise of the lecturers. Topics will range from the processing of information at the neural level (i.e., integrate and fire neurons) to high-level cognitive phenomena (i.e., learning and action planning). Matlab programming will be used to implement the models discussed in the lectures, so students will gain hands-on experience.

## Aims
Translate a computational model in a script
Test hypothesis using simulations
Produce reports about quantitative model testing
## Learning outcomes
The module will give you the skills to implement computational models capturing the properties of neural and cognitive functions. Lectures will provide an overview of topics in computational and mathematical modelling in neuroscience, psychophysics, and psychology with an emphasis on the area of expertise of the lecturers. Topics will range from the processing of information at the neural level (i.e., integrate and fire neurons) to high-level cognitive phenomena (i.e., learning and action planning). Matlab programming will be used to implement the models discussed in the lectures, so students will gain hands-on experience.

You'll first refresh Matlab coding, learn to implement and test simple models producing a report and try a different kind of implementations over the course of the module, so to give you a flavour of all kind of models that exist out there.
